During the conversation Matt mentions [Finagle](http://twitter.github.io/finagle/), [NginX](https://nginx.org/en/), [Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix), [HA Proxy](http://www.haproxy.org/) and [Istio](https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/istio.io). It was recorded several months prior to being published.

Eric Anderson: ([00:00](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=0.94))  
Today, we are discussing Envoy, an open source edge and service proxy designed for cloud native applications. I'm joined by Matt Klein, a software engineer at Lyft and creator of the project. Matt, you started Envoy in mid 2016 since then has become the 11th project to join the cloud native computing foundation received 3000 commits from 230 contributors. It's been starred by 7,000 GitHub users. How did we get here? How did this all begin?

Matt Klein: ([00:32](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=32.86))  
Sure. A that's a fun, fun thing to think about at a this point. Um, so yeah, so I've been working in networking and distributed systems for uh, probably about the last 10 years now. Uh, in that 10 year span I worked on ECE two within Amazon on networking. Uh, from there I went to Twitter. Uh, and the Twitter, I spent a fair amount of time working on Twitter's a front proxy. So I built a Twitter's a proxy, uh, that at that time was terminating speedy a H two H one. Uh, so at Twitter I was exposed a lot to, you know, different edge proxy concepts, but at the same time, I was also, uh, present for a lot of the work that was going on in these services, service networking space. Um, so obviously Twitter has a, a very powerful library called a

Matt Klein: ([01:27](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=87.63))  
finagle and, um, you know, so I was definitely aware of the, uh, of the different work that was going on there. Uh, so when I left, uh, Twitter and I came to Lyft, Lyft at that time, uh, had a, a large monolithic application written in PHP. Uh, at the time that I joined, there are probably 20 or 30 different Python microservices. And, you know, I have obviously talked about this a lot, but, uh, Lyft was having, you know, very common problems with their micro service, uh, deployments. Um, they were having problems around, you know, understanding, uh, where different things were actually happening. So like, where are the problems happening within the network, within the application. Um, you know, and, uh, we were in a situation where, uh, we had developers who, you know, we were basically telling to deploy microservices. Uh, but those developers did not trust the microservices deployment.

Matt Klein: ([02:27](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=147.69))  
Uh, so we were in a, we were in a pretty bad situation, um, where, you know, we had a bunch of microservices. We had this monolith. Uh, we had developers who didn't want to write microservices because they didn't trust the network. They didn't understand how to observe it. They didn't understand how to, uh, fix problems. Um, so then they wanted to write their features back in the, uh, monolithic application. So we were in this, you know, split world, uh, which was, which was not great. Um, so just having experienced what happened to Twitter and obviously seeing what other people were doing at different companies. Um, you know, I think we knew at Lyft that we needed to head in a, you know, in a direction, um, such as having an edge proxy to do a routing. Uh, and then we obviously had to start figuring out how to do service to service communication.

Matt Klein: ([03:17](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=197.86))  
And we had to do that in a consistent way. Um, and at that time, you know, we already had PHP at, at, at lift. Um, we obviously have Python. I think there already might have been like a Java service. Uh, even very early on we were starting to think about are we gonna write more services in a, you know, like a language like go or Java or something else. Um, you know, so that brings us back to the, to the second common problem that most people have, which is once you, uh, you know, go in and start to try to solve some of these problems, you, you know, you're faced with two, two different solutions. You can figure out an out of a process proxy solution or you could start writing, uh, libraries. Uh, and I think just having seen, uh, the pros and cons of the library based approach, both at Twitter as well as other companies.

Matt Klein: ([04:10](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=250.03))  
Um, I pretty strongly did not want to go with the library based approach. And that was really mostly around, uh, one, you know, having to support it in every, every different language, which becomes a huge maintenance burden. Uh, and two, you know, for those of you out there that, that, you know, have tried to upgrade libraries, um, that can be a very painful thing when you have lots of different services, it can take months and months and months. So, you know, I, I think, uh, that there's some pretty big downsides to the library based approach. So that led us to, you know, thinking well, okay, so we're going to do a, we're going to do an out of process proxy approach. And obviously once you go down that path, there's lots of different options. Um, you know, you could, uh, build something on top of an existing library such as Finagle, or Netflix's Histrix, um, or you can take an existing proxy like ha proxy or engine X. um, you know, and I think lots of people have asked me, well, you know, why, why did you go and build this thing from scratch?

Matt Klein: ([05:13](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=313.24))  
Like, why didn't you use an existing proxy? Uh, and you know, I, I think the answer to that is, uh, I had been doing, you know, this networking stuff for, for quite some time. Uh, I had a lot of exposure to ha proxy as well as NginX. um, I was, uh, I was pretty convinced that, you know, it was important that we went for a, a very high performance, low latency solution. Uh, so that meant that we didn't want to do something in a, any language like Java. Um, you know, so that, that led us at that time in 2015, you know, with a, a native code solution. Um, so that pretty much was, you know, should we use engine X should be used at your proxy or should we build, build something ourselves. You know, I'm going to be honest in saying that at Lyft in 2015 definitely had some conversations that, you know, that went along the lines of, well, let's just build something in Python, you know, and, and, you know, we can do it in Python and then if it becomes a problem later, we can, we can swap it out.

Matt Klein: ([06:18](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=378.02))  
Um, you know, so there were definitely conversations around, you know, did, did it make sense to do a very high performance solution or given where, uh, you know, Lyft was at the time, like, should we, should we do something a little bit faster, uh, you know, with, with possibly lower, lower perf. So at the time, you know, this was myself and obviously, I mean, the company when I joined, uh, I wanna say probably had only 70 or 80 developers. So, you know, it was a, it was a pretty small organization. And like of that 70 or 80 people, there were probably the only, at that time, I'm guessing 10 or 15 people working in what we would now call, you know, dev ops or in front, um, you know, so the set of people that were making decisions back then was, was, was quite small.

Matt Klein: ([07:04](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=424.85))  
Um, you know, so we had, we had a lot of conversations around, you know, obviously, do we use an existing system that we can build on, do we like do something in Python? Um, or do we do what, what ended up actually happening, which was to build our, our own proxy. And, uh, to be totally honest with you, you know, in, in hindsight, uh, I, I think it's fairly incredible that Envoy actually came, came to be in, in that environment. Um, you know, I think that Lyft was willing to give me a large piece of rope with which to hang myself. And, uh, you know, that was a great experience. And, uh, you know, I, I think that it definitely could've gone different ways. Uh, I think people could have been very adamant that, you know, we're not going to build something from scratch. We should like do it with engine X rates, your proxy and build some Lula plugins, um, you know, or, or we should build an empire, Ethan and then swap it out or something like that, you know?

Matt Klein: ([08:10](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=490.28))  
And, uh, I think primarily based on my prior experience, the fact that I have built something at, at Twitter, you know, that was kind of like this. So this was a little bit of a V2. Um, I was fairly confident that I could do it relatively quickly. Um, and just having, uh, you know, having dealt with those other solutions, I was, I was fairly confident that there was a need within the industry for a more and more modern proxy solution. Um, you know, something that was built more for, I guess, you know, now what we would call the, uh, quote cloud native space or, or we'll be called now, the service mesh based. But those, those things didn't really exist that much at, at that time in early 2015. So, uh, you know, so was definitely given a lot of rope to hang myself with, as I said.

Matt Klein: ([08:59](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=539.04))  
And, uh, and we went off and essentially started it, started coding and, you know, of course it wasn't entirely from scratch. Right? I mean, it's like I was, uh, I was building on knowledge, uh, you know, from, from what I had done at Twitter. So I, I knew, you know, it was empty files, but I knew what I had done. I knew what I'd done wrong there. Um, I knew what libraries to use and what and what libraries not not to use, uh, you know, and we were able to get something into production in only, you know, about three or four months. And of course, you know, that first version was a, was a very, uh, as a very simple thing compared to what we have today. Um, but I'm a, I'm a huge believer in, uh, not doing big banks. I think it's very important to, you know, build something small and then, and then, you know, essentially take it from there.

Matt Klein: ([09:51](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=591.03))  
So, you know, we started with a very small feature set within Envoy. We actually rolled out from an edge proxy perspective first. Um, so that was replacing a, you know, a S uh, our, our existing edge proxy, which was the Amazon elastic load balancer. Uh, and you know, immediately just the observability that we had, you know, from, from sticking Envoy there at that time. And that was only, you know, that was only an H one solution. Uh, you know, we, we weren't even terminating TLS, you know, it was a, it was a very simple thing back then. Um, but even the basic version just, you know, getting out different timing data, you know, different dynamic response, go data, different types of logs, uh, that was very, uh, very, very valuable. Uh, and then, you know, from there it just grew organically. Um, you know, we were having a bunch of issues with Mongo DB at the time and, uh, you know, so we decided, well, you know, we were running at your proxy next to our, a monolith to help talking to Mongo DB, but there were issues.

Matt Klein: ([10:56](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=656.79))  
So we swapped that out with Envoy. Uh, we ended up writing a protocol parser for Mongo DB to get really interesting stats. Uh, and that was the, that was the beginning of our a service mesh. We had our edge proxy talking to our monolith with Envoy running as a sidecar. And then, you know, the, the, the rest is pretty much history, uh, you know, in the sense that we just kept adding features. And then we rolled out Envoy everywhere. And, you know, of course I'm greatly, uh, simplifying what actually happened, but, um, you know, that's, that's pretty much it. Right?

Eric Anderson: ([11:30](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=690.38))  
This is awesome. So, so from the beginning it sounded like you had some ambition or belief that this could be bigger than Lyft. For example, you mentioned the kind of the cloud native community. Was it was the intent that this would be an open source project and that there may be users outside of Lyft fairly soon after launch? Or what, what were your thinking around that? Yeah,

Matt Klein: ([11:54](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=714.13))  
I mean like having, having built something like this back at Twitter that wasn't, Oh no, it wasn't open source. And to be honest, I'm, I'm very happy it's not open source because it's, it's, it's not very good. Um, but, uh, you know, I, I, I think I was definitely aware that there was, there was a desire to use something like this. Now, um, what I will say is that I vastly under estimated, you know, the, the overall desire for this type of solution. Um, you know, so, so we had always planned on open sourcing. I think, you know, even from the beginning, lifted out the perspective that if we were gonna invest, you know, this, this many resources into building something like this, we should, we should open source it. So, you know, we started development, I want to say in like, may of 2015 and we opened sourced in I think September of 2016 so, you know, like a year and a couple of months.

Matt Klein: ([12:57](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=777.58))  
And, um, you know, before we went to open source in 2016, uh, we started doing a little bit of a road show. So, you know, I, I went and I talked to, you know, a couple of companies that were, uh, you know, like, like lift, so like similar type of size. Um, I actually forget now who I talked to. So like maybe like Yelp or, or, or like Stripe or like Slack, you know, companies in, in, you know, that, that type of growth period. And, um, you know, and it was a, it was very interesting conversation because I think every company that I talked to, and this is probably in like July or August of 2016, every company that I talked to, they were, uh, they were very, uh, very happy. They were very receptive. They, they thought that what we had built was, was quite cool. Um, you know, but what's very interesting about a solution like Envoy, you know, versus some, some type of product that you can just try out.

Matt Klein: ([13:56](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=836.35))  
You can't just try out Envoy. Like you can't, you know, it's not something that you can just bolt on. Like it's a fundamental change to how you run your, your infra. Um, so from a smaller company perspective, you know, I think lots of companies were growing interested. They were very fascinated, but not surprisingly now, you know, they said, well, you know, this is great, but our existing solution kind of works. And like, we would love to do this, but we just don't have the resources. Right. Right. Now. So when we open sourced in a, you know, September of 2016, I was a little sad. Right. You know, I was like, Oh, would be so great if we had gotten someone excited and you know, if someone launched with us or, or like something like that. And, you know, so when we, when we opened sourced in, uh, 20, 2016, like I said, um, you know, it was a little, uh, you know, we, we hadn't had any real uptake or traction before open sourcing.

Matt Klein: ([14:52](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=892.13))  
So it was a very organic thing. I didn't really know what would happen. I, uh, my, my dream at the time was, you know, wow of like one of Lift's peer companies, like, like Slack or Stripe or something like that. If we could just get one or two of those companies to use Envoy, like that would be an incredible success. And, um, you know, within weeks of open sourcing, and I, and I can't go into, you know, deep detail, but I had Google, I was talking to tens of engineers at Google within weeks of open sourcing. I was talking to people at Apple and I was talking to people at Microsoft. Uh, I was talking to people over at, uh, over at eBay. And, um, it was incredible to me how quickly some of these larger companies showed up. And at that point, I, I really, uh, I really realized that I had under and underestimated the desire within the industry for a more modern proxy.

Matt Klein: ([15:51](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=951.56))  
So uProxy built like Envoy, which you know, you know, uh, from, from like multiple angles. So, uh, built in a modern programming style, um, built from an API first, uh, aspect, you know, built from an accessibility perspective. I think people, especially at the larger companies, uh, you know, they had been trying to do various things bolted on top of X, your proxy and engine X. And I think, you know, just seeing this new, uh, solution and seeing, you know, that it was already running in production at, at lift. So it had some basic level of testing. Of course. Uh, I think that really excited, you know, these, these, these companies. Um, you know, and that was really the beginning. I would say towards the end of 2016 and early 2017 when, when things really started blowing up, uh, Google just became super involved, you know, and that's been a, it's been a fantastic relationship.

Matt Klein: ([16:49](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1009.49))  
Um, and then, you know, as these larger companies that had deeper needs for this type of solution came about, uh, you know, it was clear that they had the resources to actually put into developing it, to actually deploying it and then, you know, throughout 2017 and into this year, um, you know, at this point, like all of lifts, peer companies like Stripe and, and like Slack and Yelp and, and everyone, right? I mean, they're all, they're all basically using Envoy now or they're in final testing before production deployment. So like everyone at this point, you know, is, is pretty much either using Envoy or is planning on using Envoy. Um, but it's, it's just been an interesting evolution for me to see. Uh, it did not happen how I thought it would happen. Like, I thought that, you know, maybe some small companies would, would use it.

Matt Klein: ([17:41](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1061.36))  
Right. And you know, not in my wildest dreams that I think that like Amazon or Microsoft or like Google or Apple would wouldn't, you know, end up actually using it because I just figured, well, you know, they would have some solution in house and like why would they actually bothered? Uh, but it, but it has turned out that, uh, Envoy has been very compelling for companies of pretty much every size. Uh, and it was the large companies first, you know, then the medium companies and now, you know, we have probably over 10, 10 or more startups, right, that are building products on top of Envoy. And I think that that's how Envoy will we really go to the masses, if you will. Um, you know, on, and I think for smaller accompanies, um, you know, I think a lot of people are going to end up using Envoy, uh, but they're going to use it via other products and they're probably not even going to be aware that they're actually using Envoy. Like they'll, they'll, they'll buy some other products and that product will be, will be built on top. So, you know, it's been a, it's been a pretty, a pretty amazing journey.

Eric Anderson: ([18:47](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1127.18))  
Yeah. So cert, super amazing journey. Um, it sounds like the, the launch of course was kind of an inflection point for you.

Matt Klein: ([18:55](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1135.44))  
Uh, w w what are the mechanics of the launch? I mean, uh,

Eric Anderson: ([18:58](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1138.88))  
in order to get the attention of Google and others, was there, was there fanfare or is this kind of just release on get hub? I imagine there was a blog post.

Matt Klein: ([19:06](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1146.49))  
Yeah, it's, you know, it's, it's funny to actually think back through this, and I've, I've said this to many people recently, um, you know, if I, if I look at the last say, two, two years of my life or two years plus a couple of months, I feel like I have not learned a single thing technically, but I have learned so much about just what it takes to, you know, to build a vibrant, open source community. And it is, it is not easy. Uh, and, you know, it is, um, the best way that I can describe it is, you know, it's like, it's like starting your own company and, and, and, and you're doing all of the roles, right? You're like the chief marketing officer. Uh, you're the PR person, you know, so you're, so yeah, you're sitting there like figuring out how to use Twitter, uh, blog posts, conferences.

Matt Klein: ([20:03](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1203.28))  
Um, and, and you know, on top of that there's a smaller things that are super important that I think a lot of projects don't spend enough time working on. But, but ended up being critical. For example, documentation. Uh, you know, before we open source Envoy, I remember I actually took an entire week where I stayed home, I called it a documentation, uh, and I just, I spent like 50 hours just like writing documentation. Uh, and you know, I think that's one of the things that caught caught people's eye very, very early on. And, and that's kinda what I'm saying is that there is a lot of, there is a lot of marketing to building a, a larger community like this. I think when you, you make an announcement, you know, the first thing people do is they're gonna go to your webpage. Like, does the webpage look professional or does it look bad?

Matt Klein: ([20:55](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1255.3))  
You know, then they're going to click on your documentation. Like, is there documentation? Does it look like it's well written as a comprehensive? So, um, although I had never done this before, I just from seeing other projects, I had a pretty good idea of, you know, of what would be required to, to actually hopefully make it, make it successful. Um, so before launch we spent a lot of time, um, or you know, doing documentation, uh, got, uh, got someone to make a logo, actually made like a webpage. Um, you know, uh, got set up to do Twitter. Um, you know, started to think about speaking at, at, at different conferences and, uh, meetups. So, you know, a big part again of, of, you know, that late 2017 period was, you know, me being a, being a cheerleader, you know, just helping whoever came along. Like, uh, you know, there's, there's lots of, there's lots of interesting stories, you know, just, just around, uh, particularly in late 2016 when Google was, was very, very interested in Envoy, you know, and at that time, uh, you know, it was, it was almost, uh, what I would envision.

Matt Klein: ([22:12](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1332.71))  
I've never gone through the process, but it was almost like, I think, uh, going through an acquisition, uh, in the sense that, you know, it's like, I, you just had tons of Google people just like asking me questions around like, why does it work this way? Like, why does it do that? Or, you know, doing a performance testing and load testing and, and asking me like, why, why is it this way? And, you know, coming, coming to me with bugs and saying, well, I tried this and it's broken, and then I would like turn around a fix in like four hours or something like that. And, you know, so it was, it was very much, uh, at that time. And, you know, and, and I, and I think if you really go back, um, you know, it, it could have gone either way. And like, I think that, uh, you know, uh, I think at the time Google was evaluating whether to build STO, uh, you know, I think they had planned on probably using engine X. um, and, you know, and I think Envoy came about and, and there was a bunch of pros for that.

Matt Klein: ([23:12](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1392.22))  
So I think that sparked a very interesting conversation within Google around which technology to actually build on. And that's, and that's when that whole kind of, you know, uh, should we, should we use this random technology from Lyft, you know, that's mostly written by this one random person. Right. And, uh, and that was a very interesting and stressful time in my life. Um, but it was, it was fun also. So, you know, that's a, that's a long, long winded answer to your question, but I think that again, there wasn't a of, there hasn't been a lot of technical stuff since, since we opened source, but just, you know, uh, I, I think we have gotten a lot of feedback, you know, that we have built a very welcoming and a very vibrant community. And that's been very important to me. And I will say that that takes a tremendous amount of effort.

Matt Klein: ([24:08](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1448.24))  
Um, just, you know, setting the right tone for the overall community, like making sure that people treat each other with respect, that people are nice during code reviews, that people have, um, you know, very, very civil discussions like when they're actually designing features. Uh, you know, these are things that take effort. But I think that that, you know, that partly comes from the top and I think that setting that type of tone, you know, it has percolated throughout the community and it honestly, it, it blows my mind sometimes now to just see, you know, people that are, you know, that that step in and help people answer questions. And, you know, fix bugs. And, um, it, it's been a, it's been a pretty amazing journey.

Eric Anderson: ([24:53](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1493.26))  
Certainly. I love the, the image of that, you know, Google feeling like an acquisition situation. Were, were there any, um, in those moments, uh, you know, at this point, I imagine Boyd proxy feels like you're your baby in a sense. And, and although, uh, you know, Google's not actually trying to, uh, you know, acquire your baby, like w were there any anxiety, certainly a lot of enthusiasm, but were there any anxieties around, you know, what's gonna happen? Is this going to get derailed in some way? Uh, or is it mostly positive vibes throughout the whole thing?

Matt Klein: ([25:30](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1530.04))  
Well, you know, so very, very early on. So this is, again, this is in early fall of 2016. I'll be honest, I was definitely concerned. Um, just about, um, you know, like if, if Google came on in, in force, you know, uh, would they force changes in product direction? Like would we get mired and lots of discussion and then like not, not be able to move fast. And I'm, I'm, I'm going to be honest, the, the people, uh, all of the people that I have worked with at Google on Envoy have just been absolutely fantastic. Like they're, they're incredible engineers. Uh, they're super pragmatic. Um, and you know, the, the project is absolutely better for having them than them join. So, you know, I, I think, I think I was definitely fearful. Um, but it's, it's worked out so well and, you know, and then, you know, if we go back again, like to, to, to, to that time, it was obviously amazing to get resources from a company like Google, but, you know, now, right?

Matt Klein: ([26:40](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1600.28))  
It's like we have people from Apple who are maintainers, like we have, uh, I mean, we're getting commits all the time from tons of different companies. Um, so at this point, of course, you know, I think if you went and you go through the, the commits, I'm sure the majority of commits are all, the majority of commits are probably from, from me still. Um, but the folks at Google have done incredible work. But I guess my larger point is that now we get very sophisticated PRS, like not just bug fixes from lots of different companies. So it's a, it's a true multi-company effort now. Um, and I think again, that that's, that's just what has been so amazing about this is to see it grow, you know, from a lift thing to like a lift and a Google thing to like a lift and a Google and an Apple thing to now, you know, you could just go through the different commits. And again, I don't even know. I mean we're getting a very sophisticated stuff from like square VMware and so all, all types of companies. So that's just fantastic.

Eric Anderson: ([27:45](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1665.17))  
And is, you know, you wonder in a project like there might be one motivation to just get everyone to use it. It sounds like at the beginning you just were excited if, if a company wanted to use Envoy and then there's this other kind of goal maybe around the project to get contributors. Um, was that ever something that you were excited to bring in or you know, more contributors, people who can add this feature, that feature? Um, or, or did that kind of just happen organically? You know, it's a combination of organic, but \[inaudible\]

Matt Klein: ([28:17](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1697.22))  
it's, it's, it's what I was talking about before is building a, uh, building a larger community. Sorry, one sec. Building a larger community is it, it just takes a lot of work, right? And so like cultivating maintainers or encouraging people to, to like keep fixing bugs and like helping them grow and learn, you know, learn the code base. Um, that, that all takes effort. But, you know, I, I learned very early on, particularly in late 2016 and early 2017, um, that was probably the most stress that I've ever been in in my entire life. I mean, just the project just blew up, you know, and just the influx of people that were coming in with either questions or PRS or all of these things. And you know, the, the stress of getting everyone on the same page of, you know, what, uh, what does the code quality look like?

Matt Klein: ([29:22](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1762.87))  
And like, are we all aligned? And you know, that that takes a lot of time and a lot of effort. So if I look, you know, into the spring of 2017, you know, there's all this community stuff going on and, uh, you know, fantastic experience, stressful, and at the same time, you know, and that's when all of the venture capitalists start showing up, you know, and I obviously wrote an entire blog post on this, but you know, so that, that time was made more stressful because there's all of this community building, like the project is, is boiling up. And then, you know, I don't, I don't want to say harassed, but I mean, I'm, I'm getting a lot of inbound from VCs. Uh, and you know, so trying to balance like all of these different competing forces, particularly in the first half of 2017 was very, very difficult.

Matt Klein: ([30:17](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1817.43))  
Uh, so that was a, that was a very stressful time in my life. Um, and, uh, you, you know, eh, and it was, it was hard to obviously think through, you know, all of the different competing ways I could spend my time, like all of the different types of outcomes. Um, but ultimately, you know, if I look back to early 2017 in which I was still intimately involved in, like almost every PR that went in because people weren't familiar with the code, like I just had to be there to, to, to help. Um, whereas today, you know, we as a group have cultivated a set of maintainers and a set of contributors who make changes to the most complicated parts of the code base. So, you know, I went, uh, I went on leave for a a month, a couple of weeks ago, and uh, you know, so this is in like August of this year and the first time in a long time where I, I, I literally, I did not open get up.

Matt Klein: ([31:20](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1880.83))  
I did not check a single email. I did not open Slack. I didn't do anything for one month. And I had, I just had zero concerns. Like, because I feel like we have built that, we have built that larger community, we have that base of maintainers. Everyone genuinely sees eye to eye on design and code quality and all of those things that, you know, again, like, I don't want to say that I've totally made myself useless, but, um, you know, I, I feel like that the, the project is now self sustaining and I think that's something that I've worked really, really hard for. And, um, I think a lot of people out there when they, you know, when they, when they look at opensource or when they, you know, when they think about what a job like mine is, I think a lot of people think that it's this super glorious thing, right?

Matt Klein: ([32:13](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1933.57))  
Like, Oh, you know, Matt, you like started this open source project and it's fantastically successful. Uh, your, your, you know, this is like great all the time and it's, it's really hard work. Like really, really, really hard work, you know, doing, doing code reviews for seven or eight hours per day or you know, just again, like cultivating that larger community, like trying to make sure that we have enough maintainers that we have enough people doing support. Um, it, it's like, it's like building a company, but it's like building a company in which none of the people actually work for you. Right. So it's like open sources is in some ways total total controlled anarchy. Um, so trying to, trying to make all of that work is very complicated.

Eric Anderson: ([33:01](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1981.88))  
And, and uh, just to, uh, kind of double down on that a bit. So these, I imagine you're getting inundated with people who, some are just like asking for help or answer a question or here's a bug and then you have others that maybe look like they could be potential maintainers in the future. They're offering, you know, guidance and sending you lots of PRS. How does, how did those maintainers emerge? I, I imagine you're eager to find people you trust that they understand and can share the vision and can you can offload work and components to in the super busy time. Yeah. You know, and like it's

Matt Klein: ([33:36](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2016.18))  
a, it's definitely an evolving process. So, you know, when I was initially trying to build the, the larger community around the project, like anyone that asked any question, right? Like whether it be in get up or email or Slack, like I would just be sitting there like basically asking, you know, answering any question that anyone asked. And that was important, you know, during the, during the early phases because that's just, that's that, that's how you build one of these things. Um, but that's not scalable. Like it's not scalable from a stress level. For me, it's not scalable from a larger project perspective. So I don't, I don't have a firm answer for you. And, and honestly, one day I may end up writing an entire book on this because it has been, has been such a journey. Um, but it's, it's trying to find the right balance.

Matt Klein: ([34:27](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2067.42))  
So, you know, it's, it's trying to look for people that maybe just out of, out of fun, um, you know, we're doing a couple of PRS here and there and, you know, I'll, I'll just see these PRS and look at them and say, wow, like this, this person is fantastic. Like they just did all this work and like, they didn't ask any questions about it, you know, and then I'll try to find, you know, I'll, I'll, I'll do a little internet stalking and try to find out like how to contact them or who they are. And, and some of that doesn't lead anywhere because some people just do, you know, do a PR because they need it for their job or, or they're just, you know, doing it for a hobby. And sometimes it, it, it does, it does lead somewhere. So, uh, there's, there's actually this one, one guy named D who, uh, he lives in Indonesia and I don't even remember now, you know, he, he started just, I think just doing Envoy PRS for fun, like probably like six, seven or eight or eight months ago.

Matt Klein: ([35:27](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2127.33))  
And, uh, I think maybe he was working with some Indonesian tech companies or, you know, but he also owned a bakery. Like it's a, it's like a pretty crazy story. Um, you know, so he had been doing all this work, like it was really fantastic and, um, you know, and then I just, I just reached out, you know, and I was like, are you interested in potentially being in maintainer? And, you know, fast forward now, not only is he a maintainer, but he actually works for an Envoy startup. Um, so, you know, it just shows you, uh, like that. That's what is so amazing to me about some of this open source stuff. Like it doesn't always work this way, but you do have these incredible stories of just like people around the world who would just hop in out of interest and then it leads to a full time job. Right. And like, that's, it's just like, so, so amazing to me.

Eric Anderson: ([36:19](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2179.5))  
Amazing. Take us now to where to where we're at today. Um, it sounds like these maintainers kind of play a governance role with the project. Uh, how does kind of the project operate today? Um, yeah, in terms of governance and then, and then we'll shift gears eventually to, to where you want to see this thing go.

Matt Klein: ([36:38](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2198.89))  
Yeah. So, um, yeah, so I mean we, we as, as part of joining CNCF and partly because I wanted to get ahead of any governance issues, you know, we, we, we have set up a governance system, so we have a concept of senior maintainers and maintainers. And like, if we have a dispute, there's a documented voting process. To be honest, we have never yet had to invoke this voting process. Um, I, you know, in general, we're very careful of who we let become a maintainer. I think we take it slow, try to make sure that everyone sees idol. Um, and, you know, I'm not, uh, I'm not naive. Like, I'm sure that eventually something's going to happen and like we are, we are going to have to vote. Um, but you know, that's, that's, that's there. Um, but I think, you know, I think I'm still probably looked at as the project lead.

Matt Klein: ([37:34](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2254.78))  
Um, so, you know, at least from a design discussion perspective, like sometimes I, I will weigh in my opinion, um, but I, I don't really like the benevolent dictator or title because that's not what we're going for a year. Like I think it's the, um, you know, I think we're trying to build a, a community of people that can make technical decisions and like, hopefully we should be mostly aligned. Uh, and that's what's happened so far. But like I said before, it's, it's, it's hard to cultivate that, you know, I mean, you can't, you can't, like, you have to do it very, very carefully. It's, to me, it's no different than building a company. I have to be very careful with who you hire. Like once you hire people, firing people is very difficult, right? So, um, you know, I think when you build these larger communities, particularly around maintainers, that people that have commit access, it takes a lot of thought.

Matt Klein: ([38:26](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2306.83))  
You know, to make sure that people, people see IDI, uh, and, and have compatible personalities. Um, and like I said, that's where, uh, especially some of the Google folks, uh, you know, what is interesting is almost all of, if I think about it now, almost all of the existing Envoy maintainers have very little previous experience doing opensource. Like most of us are all, you know, proprietary mercenary type developers. So I, you know, maybe, maybe that's part of it is that none of us I don't think really had any preconceived notions. Like we didn't really know what we were doing. So I think we've just kind of figured it out. Uh, but, but, you know, I, I think, I think it's just going slow and just trying to make sure that we have the right people. And I, you know, like I say, always, always be scaling, right? It's like trying to find people that are, that are into it. And I will reach out to them and see if they want to, you know, want, want to become maintainers. So, uh, it's a, it's a never ending process.

Eric Anderson: ([39:33](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2373.26))  
Awesome. And where, where do you go from here? So like is there a backlog of features and things you want to do on the project and it mostly fully baked and this is kind of maintenance and bugs. Uh, no, there's, I'm curious, are there other kinds of ecosystem, you know, things you're navigating where it was placed in the world, right? I mean

Matt Klein: ([39:54](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2394.65))  
probably even the subject of a, of a different podcast. But you know, I think from a, from an open source economics perspective, it's, uh, it's quite interesting just in the sense that one of the reasons that Envoy has been so successful is that we are a community first project. Like we don't have to reconcile, uh, whether if we take a feature or patch from someone that it's going to break our, our underlying business model because there is no business model for Envoy itself. Uh, and that has a powerful thing. With that said, the reason that Envoy is, is funded so highly by different companies is that companies are building products on, on top, right? So that's going to be control systems, that's going to be observability systems. There's, there's no end to the number of things that, that, that can end up being built on top.

Matt Klein: ([40:48](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2448.89))  
So what's interesting is that, you know, there's a, there's a delicate balance here where the, I think there's a ton that can be done within the Envoy project itself that we haven't even touched on yet. Like different protocols, support, uh, more types of dynamic load balancing, like adoptive load balancing. Uh, I, there's just tons of different things, but you know, we don't necessarily want to go into higher level control systems or UIs or stuff like that in the project itself because that's where it becomes complicated because that's where some of the people that are funding on board development are themselves making money. Uh, and then I think you can get into this situation of, you know, now there's portions of the project that might be competing with, with some of the paid offerings. So, you know, I think, um, that's a, a balance that we will have to kind of find in the future of where, how to keep the project community driven.

Matt Klein: ([41:51](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2511.11))  
Uh, how would they keep it running for all the people that actually want to use it as a, as a foundational part of their system? Uh, but you know, have to be careful to not, uh, you know, spin up some part of the project that might directly compete with, uh, you know, with some of the companies that end up end up funding it. And again, like I don't, I don't have a firm answer for you there. Uh, that's, that's something that we're just going to have to look at as we go. Uh, but that's, that's a very interesting balance that I think will, will, will be there. But from a roadmap perspective, I think there's a lot of stuff that can be done and built in that just hasn't been funded. Um, you know, for, for myself, uh, I've, I've obviously written about this. I would, I would love to see a CNCF and other foundations, you know, offer a full time fellowships, um, for, for people to actually work on something like Envoy full time so that they can focus on community driven development.

Uh, but, but, but not have to work for a particular company. Um, so that's something that I think will end up being discussed more and more over the next couple of years. Uh, but right now, you know, it's, I, I think because we're just moving forward and, and development is really being driven by all of the companies that are using Envoy for their own products. Um, it's hard to have a roadmap. Like everyone's always asking what is envoys roadmap? Well, you know, for a community driven projects pretty hard to have a roadmap because like, I don't know what people are going to end up implementing. So, uh, that's, that's actually pretty interesting.

Yeah, this is, this is great. It's wonderful to hear your story and the story of Envoy as we wrap up here, Matt, it'd be great to, if you have any kind of requests for the community or, um, you know, if people after hearing this are interested about the project, you know, things that they can do to get involved. Any suggestions there?

Matt Klein: ([43:46](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=iTkz0DyOi0TmmuxbwRYO_FbBXie2kdeW6rPi_OnuQsagxZXpludMSRTbbW1dICcLulk7TdN8Ckm7cJCzdzKZhXr9Knw&loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=2626.88))  
I, I think I would just say to folks out there that we have tried very hard to have a very welcoming community. So we have a gear up, we have Slack, we have all of our email addresses, we have a new developer guide. Uh, we are always up to date in terms of help wanted, we have easy issues marked as beginner. Um, C plus plus is less scary than I think the internet would, would like people to believe. So, uh, you know, it's there. Uh, there are, there are lots of options for getting involved and even apart from coding, as in every project, we're desperate for people to help with documentation, with tutorials, uh, with, with blog posts. You know, there are so many ways to get involved and you know, I see myself mostly as a a facilitator, you know, so people can always reach out to me. Uh, my, my contact info is pretty easy to find, um, or reach out one of the project aliases. But, uh, always, always happy to have people get involved. Thanks so much, man. Uh, congrats on an amazing project and best to your going forward. Thank you. Thank you very much for having me.
